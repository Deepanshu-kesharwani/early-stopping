# Early Stopping in Neural Networks

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the implementation of Early Stopping, an important regularization technique to prevent overfitting in neural network training. The example uses a simple binary classification problem with the `make_circles` dataset.

## Overview

Early stopping is a technique that stops training when the model performance on a validation set begins to degrade. This helps prevent overfitting and improves model generalization. This notebook shows:

1. How to create and visualize a simple dataset
2. How to build a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras
3. How to implement early stopping during model training
4. How to visualize the model's decision boundary

## Requirements

This notebook requires the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- MLxtend (for decision boundary plotting)
- Scikit-learn

## Contents

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Data Generation**: Creates a synthetic dataset using `make_circles` from scikit-learn
2. **Data Visualization**: Uses seaborn to visualize the generated data
3. **Data Splitting**: Splits data into training and testing sets
4. **Model Building**: Creates a simple neural network with a single hidden layer
5. **Model Training**: 
   - First trains a model without early stopping
   - Then trains a model with early stopping
6. **Visualization**: Shows training vs. validation loss curves and decision boundaries

## Early Stopping Implementation

The notebook demonstrates how to implement early stopping in Keras using the `EarlyStopping` callback:

```python
callback = EarlyStopping(
    monitor="val_loss",
    min_delta=0.0001,
    patience=20,
    verbose=1,
    mode="auto",
    baseline=None,
    restore_best_weights=False
)
```

The parameters control:
- `monitor`: What metric to monitor (usually validation loss)
- `min_delta`: Minimum change in the monitored quantity to qualify as improvement
- `patience`: Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will stop
- `verbose`: Verbosity mode
- `mode`: One of {"auto", "min", "max"}
- `restore_best_weights`: Whether to restore model weights from the epoch with the best value of the monitored quantity

## Usage

To run this notebook:
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed
2. Execute each cell sequentially
3. Observe how early stopping affects training
4. Experiment with different parameters for early stopping and network architecture

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a practical demonstration of how early stopping can be implemented to prevent overfitting in neural networks. By monitoring validation loss and stopping training when it begins to increase, we can create more generalizable models.
